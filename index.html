        <p id="p1"> The game starts with a toss and is played on the basis of overs where each over has 6 balls to be bowled. Runs can be scored by hitting the ball out of the boundary in the form of fours and sixes or by running between the wickets to take singles. The total number of overs depends on the format of the game. </p>

        <p id="p2"> My favorite cricket player is Anil Kumble. Anil Kumble is currently the Head Coach and the Director of Cricket Operations of Kings XI Punjab. Twenty-one years ago, at the Feroz Shah Kotla stadium, Kumble became only the second bowler after England's Jim Laker to claim 10 wickets in an innings of a Test match. He finished with figures of 10 for 74 in 26.3 overs. He is a bowler of his own kind: a brisk top-spin bowler, making the ball turn a little both ways; tall at six foot two and dangerously bouncy on a hard pitch; and as persistently accurate in finding his target as a mosquito. Not one of his 105 victims was stumped. </p>
